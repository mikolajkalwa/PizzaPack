It is necessary to have 10 \\u2013 80\\r\\nliters of water flowing from the fully open\\r\\ntap in one minute to have your machine\\r\\nrun smoothly. Attach a pressure reducing\\r\\nvalve if water pressure is higher.\\r\\nC If you are going to use the double waterinlet product as a single (cold) water-inlet\\r\\nunit, you must install the supplied stopper\\r\\nto the hot water valve before operating the\\r\\nproduct. (Applies for the products supplied\\r\\nwith a blind stopper group.)\\r\\nA WARNING: Models with a single water\\r\\ninlet should not be connected to the hot\\r\\nwater tap. In such a case the laundry will\\r\\nget damaged or the product will switch to\\r\\nprotection mode and will not operate.\\r\\nA WARNING: Do not use old or used water\\r\\ninlet hoses on the new product.

Otherwise,\\r\\nyour laundry will come out hot at the end\\r\\nof the washing process and wear out.\\r\\n2. Tighten all hose nuts by hand. Never use a tool\\r\\nwhen tightening the nuts.\\r\\n3.Open the taps completely after making the\\r\\nhose connection to check for water leaks at\\r\\nthe connection points. If any leaks occur, turn\\r\\noff the tap and remove the nut. Retighten the\\r\\nnut carefully after checking the seal.

Moreover, there\\r\\nis risk of scalding due to high washing\\r\\ntemperatures! To prevent such situations\\r\\nand to ensure smooth water intake and\\r\\ndischarge of the machine, fix the end\\r\\nof the discharge hose tightly so that it\\r\\ncannot come out.\\r\\n\\u2022 The hose should be attached to a height of at\\r\\nleast 60 cm, and 90 cm at most.\\r\\n\\u2022 In case the hose is elevated after laying it on\\r\\nthe floor level or close to the ground (less than\\r\\n60 cm above the ground), water discharge\\r\\nbecomes more difficult and the laundry may\\r\\ncome out excessively wet. Therefore, follow the\\r\\nheights described in the figure.\\r\\n\\u2022 To prevent flowing of dirty water back into the\\r\\nmachine and to allow for easy discharge, do not\\r\\nimmerse the hose end into the dirty water or do\\r\\nnot drive it in the drain more than 15 cm. If it is\\r\\ntoo long, cut it short.\\r\\n\\u2022 The end of the hose should not be bent, it\\r\\nshould not be stepped on and the hose must\\r\\nnot be pinched between the drain and the\\r\\nmachine.\\r\\n\\u2022 If the length of the hose is too short, use it by\\r\\nadding an original extension hose. Length of the\\r\\nhose may not be longer than 3.2 m. To avoid\\r\\nwater leak failures, the connection between\\r\\nthe extension hose and the drain hose of the\\r\\nproduct must be fitted well with an appropriate\\r\\nclamp as not to come off and leak.\\r\\n3.6 Adjusting the feet\\r\\nA WARNING: In order to ensure that\\r\\nthe product operates more silently\\r\\nand vibration-free, it must stand level\\r\\nand balanced on its feet.

Dry the inside of\\r\\nthe bellow with a clean piece of cloth after the\\r\\nprogramme has come to an end.\\r\\nC Repeat Drum Cleaning process in every\\r\\n2 months.\\r\\nC Use an anti-limescale suitable for the\\r\\nwashing machines.\\r\\nAfter every washing check that no foreign\\r\\nsubstance is left in the drum.\\r\\nIf the holes on the bellow shown in the figure is\\r\\nblocked, open the holes using a toothpick.\\r\\nC Foreign metal substances will cause\\r\\nrust stains in the drum. Clean the stains\\r\\non the drum surface by using cleaning\\r\\nagents for stainless steel. Never use steel\\r\\nwool or wire wool.\\r\\nA WARNING: Never use sponge or scrub\\r\\nmaterials. These will damage the painted\\r\\nand plastic surfaces.\\r\\n34 \\/ EN Washing Machine \\/User\\u2019s Manual\\r\\nMaintenance and cleaning\\r\\n6.3 Cleaning the body\\r\\nand control panel\\r\\nWipe the body of the machine with soapy water or\\r\\nnon-corrosive mild gel detergents as necessary,\\r\\nand dry with a soft cloth.\\r\\nUse only a soft and damp cloth to clean the\\r\\ncontrol panel.\\r\\n6.4 Cleaning the water intake filters\\r\\nThere is a filter at the end of each water intake\\r\\nvalve at the rear of the machine and also at the\\r\\nend of each water intake hose where they are\\r\\nconnected to the tap. These filters prevent foreign\\r\\nsubstances and dirt in the water to enter the\\r\\nwashing machine. Filters should be cleaned as\\r\\nthey do get dirty.\\r\\n1 Close the taps.\\r\\n2 Remove the nuts of the water intake hoses to\\r\\naccess the filters on the water intake valves.\\r\\nClean them with an appropriate brush. If the\\r\\nfilters are too dirty, take them out by means of\\r\\npliers and clean them.\\r\\n3 Take out the filters on the flat ends of the water\\r\\nintake hoses together with the gaskets and\\r\\nclean thoroughly under running water.\\r\\n4 Replace the gaskets and filters carefully in their\\r\\nplaces and tighten the hose nuts by hand.\\r\\n6.5 Draining remaining water\\r\\nand cleaning the pump filter\\r\\nThe filter system in your machine prevents solid\\r\\nitems such as buttons, coins and fabric fibers\\r\\nclogging the pump impeller during discharge of\\r\\nwashing water. Thus, the water will be discharged\\r\\nwithout any problem and the service life of the\\r\\npump will extend.\\r\\nIf the machine fails to drain water, the pump filter\\r\\nis clogged. Filter must be cleaned whenever it\\r\\nis clogged or in every 3 months. Water must be\\r\\ndrained off first to clean the pump filter.\\r\\nIn addition, prior to transporting the machine\\r\\n(e.g., when moving to another house) and in case\\r\\nof freezing of the water, water may have to be\\r\\ndrained completely.\\r\\nA WARNING: Foreign substances left\\r\\nin the pump filter may damage your\\r\\nmachine or may cause noise problem.\\r\\nA WARNING: If the product is not in use,\\r\\nturn the tap off, detach the supply hose\\r\\nand drain the water inside the machine\\r\\nagainst any freezing possibility in the\\r\\nregion of installation.\\r\\nA WARNING: After each use close the\\r\\nsupply hose tap of the product.\\r\\nIn order to clean the dirty filter and discharge\\r\\nthe water:\\r\\n1 Unplug the machine to cut off the supply power.\\r\\nA WARNING: Temperature of the water\\r\\ninside the machine may rise up to 90 \\u00BAC.\\r\\nTo avoid burning risk, clean the filter after\\r\\nthe water in the machine cools down.\\r\\n2 Open the filter cap.\\r\\nWashing Machine \\/User\\u2019s Manual 35 \\/ EN\\r\\nMaintenance and cleaning\\r\\n3 Some of our products have emergency draining\\r\\nhose and some does not have. Follow the steps\\r\\nbelow to discharge the water.\\r\\nDischarging the water when the product has\\r\\nan emergency draining hose:\\r\\na Pull the emergency draining hose out from its\\r\\nseat\\r\\nb Place a large container at the end of the hose.\\r\\nDrain the water into the container by pulling\\r\\nout the plug at the end of the hose. When the\\r\\ncontainer is full, block the inlet of the hose\\r\\nby replacing the plug. After the container is\\r\\nemptied, repeat the above procedure to drain\\r\\nthe water in the machine completely.\\r\\nc When draining of water is finished, close the\\r\\nend by the plug again and fix the hose in its\\r\\nplace.\\r\\nd Turn the pump filter to take it out.\\r\\nDischarging the water when the product\\r\\ndoes not have an emergency draining hose:\\r\\na Place a large container in front of the filter to\\r\\ncatch water from the filter.\\r\\nb Loosen pump filter (anticlockwise) until water\\r\\nstarts to flow. Fill the flowing water into the\\r\\ncontainer you have placed in front of the filter.\\r\\nAlways keep a piece of cloth handy to absorb\\r\\nany spilled water.\\r\\nc When the water inside the machine is finished,\\r\\ntake out the filter completely by turning it.\\r\\n4 Clean any residues inside the filter as well as\\r\\nfibers, if any, around the pump impeller region.\\r\\n5 Install the filter.\\r\\n6 If the filter cap is composed of two pieces, close\\r\\nthe filter cap by pressing on the tab.
